### Install and run postgres

#### Via Docker
<details>
  <summary>Via Docker</summary>

### Install Fedora's Docker implementation

```sh
sudo dnf groupinstall 'Development Tools' 'Development Libraries'
sudo dnf install moby-engine libpq-devel postgresql docker-compose
 
sudo usermod -aG docker dev
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

Note: sudo dnf install python3-devel instead of groupinstall development stuff will work for Python.h etc (needed for psycopg2 build later)
groupinstall 'Development Tools' installs things like gcc,'Development Libraries' too, and is my recommendation.
libpq-devel is postgres devel headers etc 
The above needed for psycopg2 to successfully install later

### Postgres via docker

Create a project directory and put the below in its docker-compose.yml file.

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  db:
    image: postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secret
    volumes:
      - ../db:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
  pgadmin:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4
    restart: always
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: jason@jasonbrunelle.com
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: example
    ports:
      - 8080:80
```
### Set your environment variables

#### Linux

```sh
sudo vim /etc/environment
```

Add the following

```
export PGUSER=app
export PGPASSWORD=654321
export PGHOST=localhost
export PGPORT=5432
export PGDATABASE=project_name
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://${PGUSER}@${PGHOST}:${PGPORT}/${PGDATABASE}
```

Reboot the system or your user won't have group permission for Docker & environment variables won't yet be loaded.

Start the containers (--build makes sure it rebuilds the containers if anything changed)

```sh
docker-compose up -d --build
```

(Optional) Find out the name of running containers, as this will also be teh server name if connecting from PGAdmin
```sh
docker ps
```
Example output:

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE            COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                            NAMES
49b409b9ed93   postgres         "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   21 minutes ago   Up 45 seconds   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp, :::5432->5432/tcp        test_docker_db_1
fdf43e55a21b   dpage/pgadmin4   "/entrypoint.sh"         21 minutes ago   Up 45 seconds   443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp, :::8080->80/tcp   test_docker_pgadmin_1

In this case, the server name for the postgres server would be test_docker_db_1

if you need to access the db container

```sh
docker exec -it <container name> /bin/bash
```

Or if you just need psql

```sh
docker exec -it <container name> /usr/bin/psql -U postgres
```

Create a role for our dev user

```sql
  CREATE ROLE dev WITH SUPERUSER CREATEROLE CREATEDB LOGIN PASSWORD '123456';
  exit
```

From here you should not need to login to psql via docker anymore. Use native psql on host.

#### Without Docker
<details>
  <summary>Without Docker</summary>

```sh
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib python3-dev libpq-dev
sudo systemctl start postgresql.service
sudo systemctl enable postgresql.service
```

PGAdmin4 installation failed on Jammy. Isn't officially supported yet.

switch to psql user and run psql
```sh
sudo -i -u postgres
psql
```

Exit back to dev shell

```sh
exit
```

Create a role for our dev user

```sql
  CREATE ROLE dev WITH SUPERUSER CREATEROLE CREATEDB LOGIN PASSWORD '123456';
  exit
```

From here you should not need to switch to psql user to login to psql. user dev has all privileges needed.

</details>

### Connect to Database instance

The environment variables are set to connect as app to a database that doesn't exist yet. You must be explicit about how to connect via the new superuser.

```sh
psql -U dev -W -d postgres
```

After creating the database mentioned in the environment variables, you can leave off -d postgres for all future connection attempts.

### Create and connect to database

```sql
  CREATE DATABASE project_name;
  \c project_name;
```
### create a test table

```sql
CREATE TABLE test (
  id SERIAL,
  val1 VARCHAR(20),
  val2 VARCHAR(20)
);
```

Create a role for our app

```sql
  CREATE ROLE app WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '654321';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO app;
  GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO app;
```

You'll need to go back through these grants each time a new relation is created.

### Insert some dummy data for testing

```sql
INSERT INTO test VALUES(default, 'Hi', 'There');
```

## Create quick test app

### Test programmatically

<details>
  <summary>With node</summary>

Create project folder with app.js

```sh
npm init -y
npm i pg
```

Create your javascript file

```javascript
const { Pool } = require("pg");

// If you've set environment variables this is not needed
// const connectionString = 'postgresql://app:123456@localhost:5432/project_name'

const pool = new Pool({
  // If you've set environment variables this is not needed
  // connectionString,
});

(async () => {
  const client = await pool.connect();
  try {
    let res = await client.query("SELECT * FROM test");
    console.log(res.rows[0]);
    res = await client.query(
      "INSERT INTO test VALUES (default, $1, $2) RETURNING *", //or RETURNING id
      ["Hi", "Back"]
    );
    console.log(res.rows[0]);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } finally {
    client.release();
  }
})().finally(() => pool.end());
```

Does it work? Success!

<details>
  <summary>With python</summary>

Create project folder with app.py

set your virtual environment
```sh
python3 -m venv app
source app/bin/activate
pip3 install wheel
pip3 install psycopg2
```

Create your python file

```python
import psycopg2

conn = None
try:
    # connect to the PostgreSQL server
    print('Connecting to the PostgreSQL database...')
    conn = psycopg2.connect('')

    # create a cursor
    cur = conn.cursor()

# execute a statement
    print('PostgreSQL database version:')
    cur.execute('SELECT * from test;')

    # display the PostgreSQL database server version
    row = cur.fetchone()
    print(row)

# close the communication with the PostgreSQL
    cur.close()
    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute("INSERT INTO test VALUES (default, 'Hi', 'Back') RETURNING *")
    ret = cur.fetchone()
    print (ret)
    conn.commit()
except (Exception, psycopg2.DatabaseError) as error:
    print(error)
finally:
    if conn is not None:
        conn.close()
        print('Database connection closed.')

```

Does it work? Success!
